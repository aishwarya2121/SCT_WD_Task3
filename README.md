Task Description: Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

# Objective:
To build a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game (also known as X and O game) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to allow two players to play against each other on a 3×3 grid by clicking on cells and display the result — win, lose, or draw.

# Technologies Used:
HTML – for creating the structure of the webpage (grid, buttons, headings).

CSS – for styling the game board and buttons (colors, layout, hover effects).

JavaScript – for game logic like player turns, checking winners, and restarting the game.

# Features Implemented:
Game Board (3x3 grid)

Built using HTML and styled with CSS grid.

Each cell is clickable and displays either X or O based on the turn.

Player Turn Management

JavaScript tracks whose turn it is (Player X or Player O).

The turn alternates after every move.

Win Detection

Checks all possible winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals).

Declares a winner if three of the same symbols are in a line.

Draw Detection

If all cells are filled and no player wins, the game shows a draw message.

Game Reset Button

A "Restart Game" button clears the board and starts a new game.

# Learning Outcomes:
Gained hands-on experience with basic web development tools.

Learned how to use event listeners and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.

Understood how to apply conditional logic to manage game state.

Built a fully interactive front-end project.
